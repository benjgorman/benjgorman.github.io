excerpt: "A concept of a contextual phrase book to aid speechreading."
category: "Research"
description: "In certain situations, phrases and topics can be pre-associated with a given location or situation. These associations can be shown using a constellation diagram, in which a text label for the situation is placed in the middle while related topics and phrases radiate out from the situation label. Constellation diagrams help by prompting the speechreader to consider potential phrases and topics in advance of a given situation.

ContextCueView would gather contextual data (e.g., GPS, date/time) to anticipate a user’s situation. Using this contextual data, ContextCueView would load a matching previously- generated constellation diagram.

ContextCueView could run on a mobile device and operate like a ‘contextual phrase book’, but it is also well-suited for a glanceable display."
