abstract: Speech-reading is an invaluable technique for people with hearing loss or those in adverse listening conditions (e.g., in a noisy restaurant, near children playing loudly). However, speech-reading is often difficult because identical mouth shapes (visemes) can produce several speech sounds (phonemes); there is a one-to-many mapping from visemes to phonemes. This decreases comprehension, causing confusion and frustration during conversation. My doctoral research aims to design and evaluate a visualisation technique that displays textual representations of a speaker's phonemes to a speech-reader. By combining my visualisation with their pre-existing speech-reading ability, speech-readers should be able to disambiguate confusing viseme-to-phoneme mappings without shifting their focus from the speaker's face. This will result in an improved level of comprehension, supporting natural conversation.
