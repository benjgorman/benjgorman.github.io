  <p>In 2012, I graduated with a First Class (Honours) B.Sc. in Applied Computing from the <a href="https://www.dundee.ac.uk/">University of Dundee</a>.</p>
  
  <p>After taking a short break to travel around Australia, I returned to Dundee in 2014 to pursue my PhD in Computer Science (HCI) under the guidance of <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=pJjyC-AAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. David Flatla</a>. My research during this time was focused on assisting individuals with hearing loss, specifically in the realm of speechreading (commonly known as lipreading). I successfully defended my thesis in December 2017 and continued to teach as a Sessional Lecturer at Dundee until the summer of 2018.</p>
  
  <p>Since November 2018, I've been working at <a href="https://www.bournemouth.ac.uk/">Bournemouth University</a>, located on the South-Coast of England, where I am now a Senior Lecturer in Computer Science. My ongoing research at Bournemouth revolves around Accessibility within HCI.</p>
  
  <p>If you're open to discussions about potential collaborations or projects, <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#x6c;&#x74;&#111;&#x3a;&#x62;&#x67;&#111;&#114;&#x6d;&#x61;&#110;&#x40;&#x62;&#x6f;&#x75;&#x72;&#110;&#x65;&#109;&#111;&#x75;&#116;&#x68;&#46;&#x61;&#99;&#46;&#x75;&#107;">I'd be delighted to have a chat</a>.</p>
