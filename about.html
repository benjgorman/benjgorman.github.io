<p>
I help people learn to build things.
For the past decade I’ve taught full-stack software engineering, mobile development, accessibility, and user-centred computing — working with students, teams, and industry partners to develop the skills needed in modern digital product development.
</p>

<p>
My work sits at the intersection of technology, education, and human-centred design. I design and deliver curriculum, run large-scale hackathons and industry engagement events, support faculty development, and teach with a strong emphasis on clarity, judgement, and real-world practice.
</p>

<p>
I’m particularly interested in how we develop <em>taste, judgement, and technical discernment</em> in an age of AI-accelerated creation.
</p>

<h3>What I do</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Design and teach technical curriculum (full-stack, mobile, accessibility, IoT)</li>
  <li>Deliver workshops, hackathons, and industry-facing training</li>
  <li>Support faculty in adopting new tools, technologies, and teaching approaches</li>
  <li>Build collaborations between universities and industry</li>
  <li>Lead accessibility-driven HCI projects and research</li>
</ul>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
I earned my First Class BSc and PhD in Computer Science from the 
<a href="https://www.dundee.ac.uk/">University of Dundee</a>, where my doctoral research focused on accessibility and supporting people with hearing loss through technology.
I joined <a href="https://www.bournemouth.ac.uk/">Bournemouth University</a> in 2018 and now serve as a Principal Academic in Computer Science in the School of Computing and Engineering.
</p>

<h3>Open to collaboration</h3>

<p>
I’m always happy to talk about opportunities involving technical education, curriculum development, training, accessibility, or collaborative projects.
