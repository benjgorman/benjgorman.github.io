Get a clear read on what's working — and what isn't — without running a full research cycle.
</p>
<p>
You’ll receive a structured walkthrough with commentary calling out usability issues, friction points, and quick wins.
</p>

<h3>Why Choose My Teardown?</h3>  
<p>Because I’ve spent years teaching people how to design better interfaces.
Not just presenting theory — actively critiquing work, improving thinking, and showing designers, developers, and engineers how to make products clearer, simpler, more usable.</p>

<p>I've taught thousands of students to analyse interfaces, understand users, and make evidence-based design decisions — and that experience means I see issues fast. I’m known for being direct, honest, and uncomfortably clear when something isn’t working. No ego. No sugarcoating. Just improvement.</p>

<p><strong>Where others point out what is wrong, I explain why — and what to do next.</strong></p>
